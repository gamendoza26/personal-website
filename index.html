                    <h3>Welcome to my personal webpage!</h3>
                    <p>Hello! My name is Gabe, and I am a junior undergraduate at Duke studying Computer Science and Economics.
                        I am passionate about using my software development skills to build solution towards environmental sustainability.
                        By leveraging technology, I aim to address climate and energy challenges and make a positive impact on our planet through green-focused tech production.

                <p>
                    As a junior undergraduate at Duke University learning everything I can about software and coding, I am amazed at the possibilities for technology to create solutions for some of the world's greatest environmental challenges. I am using my tech skills to develop applications and interfaces that address sustainability problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in software development and data analytics. At Duke, I have learned coding skills across various programming languages including Python, Java, R, and C++. I have also gained hands-on experience with tools such as Docker, Jupyter, GIS, and Voila.

                    This past summer, I worked for Duke Facilities Management (DFM) to develop prototype models that dynamically estimate the number of people in specific facility spaces across Duke's campus using WiFi and CO2 data. This spatial occupancy knowledge allows DFM to more efficiently allocate heating and AC throughout the year. This decreases Duke's energy consumption, cutting CO2 emissions and increasing space utilization.

                    In my spare time, I love singing with my A Cappella group, The Pitchforks. We regularly sing at gigs around Duke's campuses, for the children at the Duke Hospital, and at events around the Durham area. Additionally, I love playing pickup soccer and I am currently "training" for a Gaga ball tournament this Spring!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am excited to continue leveraging my skills and passion to develop innovative solutions that address environmental challenges and make a positive impact on our world.

                        I worked for Duke Facilities Management (DFM) to develop prototype models using WiFi and CO2 data that dynamically estimate the number of people in specific facility spaces across Duke's campus. 
                        We then built interactive dashboards that allow users to display an occupancy heatmap, generate ranges of predicted counts, and specify room-by-room occupancy.
                        Our dashboards allow DFM to efficiently allocate their heating and AC throughout the year and improve space utilization.
                        This ultimately decreases Duke's energy consumption carbon footprint.

                        I worked for the Core Sound and Waterfowl Museum to develop a GIS Storymap depicting the devastating effects of Hurricane Florence in Carteret County, NC in 2018.
                        Our story walks readers through the events that took place before, during, and after Florence and the resilience of a community committed to building back stronger.
                        I interviewed locals, conducted research at the museum, and utilized my software development skills to make the GIS storymap a reality.
                        Our webpage is now available on the Core Sound's website.

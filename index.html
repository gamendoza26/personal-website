                        I worked with Duke Facilities Management to develop prototype models using WiFi and CO2 data to estimate real-time occupancy levels in specific campus facilities. Our team created interactive dashboards that display occupancy heatmaps, predict people counts, and detail room-by-room usage, enabling more efficient heating and air conditioning management. This project improved space utilization, which would significantly reduce Duke's energy consumption and carbon footprint. Using Raspberry Pi devices, we gathered CO2 data through a Python script, transmitted it to a Linux server via FastAPI, and managed the data flow using Docker containers, PostgreSQL, and GitLab CI/CD for deployment.

                        I worked for the Core Sound and Waterfowl Museum to develop a GIS Storymap depicting the devastating effects of Hurricane Florence in Carteret County, NC in 2018.
                        Our story walks readers through the events that took place before, during, and after Florence and the resilience of a community committed to building back stronger.
                        I interviewed locals, conducted research at the museum, and utilized my software development skills to make the GIS storymap a reality.
                        Our webpage is now available on the Core Sound's website.

                    As a junior undergraduate at Duke University learning everything I can about software and coding, I am amazed at the possibilities for technology to create solutions for some of the world's greatest environmental challenges. I am using my tech skills to develop applications and interfaces that address sustainability problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in software development and data analytics. At Duke, I have learned coding skills across various programming languages including Python, Java, R, and C++. I have also gained hands-on experience with tools such as Docker, Jupyter, GIS, and Voila. Finally, my personal projects have allowed me to explore HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                <p>
                    This past summer, I worked for Duke Facilities Management (DFM) to develop prototype models that dynamically estimate the number of people in specific facility spaces across Duke's campus using WiFi and CO2 data. This spatial occupancy knowledge allows DFM to more efficiently allocate heating and AC throughout the year. This decreases Duke's energy consumption, cutting CO2 emissions and increasing space utilization.

                    In my spare time, I love singing with my A Cappella group, The Pitchforks. We regularly sing at gigs around Duke's campuses, for the children at the Duke Hospital, and at events around the Durham area.

                    I am currently studying abroad in Madrid, where I have started volunteering with the YUFE Red Cross, addressing energy sustainability in the Madrid area. I am excited to continue leveraging my skills and passion to develop innovative solutions that address environmental challenges and make a positive impact on our world.
